  ## Installation
  Clone the repo to your local machine and install the dependencies, then run server.js

  ## Usage
  This is just an api back end, so you will need to make calls to the appropriate routes using a tool like Insomnia Core. The api allows you to POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE users, and user thoughts. You can also POST and DELETE to add/remove a user from another user's friends list and POST and DELETE to add or remove reactions to a user's posted thoughts.
